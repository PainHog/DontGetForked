/**
 * DON'T GET FORKED — Cross-package contracts.
 * Constants only: no imports, no Foundry globals, no logic. Every name that two
 * parts of the system must agree on (setting keys, chat-card kinds, GM operation
 * names, hook names, flag scopes) is declared here once and imported everywhere,
 * so packages built in parallel cannot drift apart; a test asserts each one is
 * actually used. Change it only on purpose, together with every user of it.
